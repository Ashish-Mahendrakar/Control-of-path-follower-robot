# Line Follower Robot with PID Control

## Overview
This project implements a line follower robot using PID control to complete a lap in 30 seconds. The robot follows a predefined path with precise control, utilizing an Arduino microcontroller.

## Components
- **Arduino Code:** Contains the code to implement PID control for the line follower robot.
- **Path PNG:** Image showing the path the robot follows.
- **Spark V PNG:** Image of the Spark V sensor used for line detection.

## Project Files
- `source_code.c` - Arduino code implementing PID control.
- `path.png` - Image of the path followed by the robot.
- `spark_v.png` - Image of the Spark V sensor used in the project.

## Setup and Usage
1. **Connect the Arduino:** Upload the `Arduino_Code.ino` file to your Arduino board.
2. **Power the Robot:** Ensure the robot is powered properly.
3. **Run the Robot:** Place the robot on the path and start it. The PID control should enable it to follow the line and complete a lap in approximately 30 seconds.
